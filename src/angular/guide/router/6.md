As you have completed the milestones, the app has naturally grown in size. As
you continue to add features, the app will get larger. At some point you'll
reach a tipping point where the app takes too long to load.

How do you combat this problem?  With asynchronous routing which loads feature modules _lazily_, on request.
Lazy loading has multiple benefits.

- You can load feature areas only when requested by the user.
- You can speed up load time for users that only visit certain areas of the app.
- You can continue expanding lazy-loaded feature areas without increasing the size of the initial load bundle.
